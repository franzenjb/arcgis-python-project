# ArcGIS Python Project

This starter project contains examples for working with the ArcGIS Python API.

## Important: If You're Lost, Read SETUP.md First!

**ðŸ‘‰ [Read the Complete Setup Guide (SETUP.md)](SETUP.md)** - This explains EVERYTHING we did step-by-step!

The SETUP.md file contains:
- Complete installation history
- All dependency issues and how we fixed them
- PATH configuration explained
- How to run Jupyter Lab
- Troubleshooting guide
- Quick reference commands

## Quick Start

### Running Examples
```bash
cd ~/arcgis_project
python3 examples/01_basic_connection.py
```

### Starting Jupyter Lab
```bash
cd ~/arcgis_project
~/Library/Python/3.9/bin/jupyter lab
```

## Verify Installation

```bash
python3 -c "import arcgis; print(arcgis.__version__)"
```

```

## Getting Started

1. Copy `config_template.py` to `config.py` and add your credentials if needed
2. Run any example script: `python3 examples/01_basic_connection.py`
3. For Jupyter notebooks: `jupyter lab` (then open any .ipynb file)

## Examples Overview

- **01_basic_connection.py**: Connect to ArcGIS Online (anonymous and authenticated)
- **02_geocoding.py**: Convert addresses to coordinates and reverse geocode
- **03_spatial_analysis.py**: Perform spatial operations and analysis
- **04_map_visualization.py**: Create interactive maps
- **05_feature_layers.py**: Query and manipulate feature layers

## Authentication

Many ArcGIS operations work without authentication. For advanced features, you'll need:
- ArcGIS Online account (free at https://developers.arcgis.com/)
- Organization URL and credentials

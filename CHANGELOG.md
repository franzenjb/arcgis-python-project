# Changelog

All notable changes and setup steps for this project.

## [Initial Setup] - 2025-10-18

### What We Did (In Order)

1. **Installed ArcGIS Package**
   - Command: `pip3 install --user arcgis`
   - Installed version 2.3.1
   - Location: `~/Library/Python/3.9/lib/python/site-packages/`

2. **Encountered Dependency Conflicts**
   - Issue: `arcgis` requires old `jupyter-client==6.1.12`
   - Issue: Modern `jupyterlab` requires newer packages
   - Result: Jupyter kernel wouldn't start

3. **Fixed Dependency Conflicts**
   - Downgraded: `jupyter_server` to <2.0 (installed 1.24.0)
   - Downgraded: `jupyterlab` to <4.0 (installed 3.6.8)
   - Downgraded: `notebook` to <7.0 (installed 6.5.7)
   - Downgraded: `ipykernel` to <6.0 (installed 5.5.6)
   - Result: ✓ Jupyter kernel now works!

4. **Configured PATH**
   - Created `~/.zshrc` file
   - Added Python bin directory to PATH
   - Result: Can now run `jupyter` command directly

5. **Created Project Structure**
   - Created 5 example scripts in `examples/` directory
   - Created `config_template.py` for credentials
   - Created `requirements.txt`
   - Created comprehensive documentation

6. **Started Jupyter Lab Successfully**
   - Command: `~/Library/Python/3.9/bin/jupyter lab`
   - Running on: http://localhost:8888
   - Kernel: ✓ Working

### Files Created

- `examples/01_basic_connection.py` - ArcGIS connection examples
- `examples/02_geocoding.py` - Geocoding operations
- `examples/03_spatial_analysis.py` - Spatial operations
- `examples/04_map_visualization.py` - Map creation
- `examples/05_feature_layers.py` - Feature layer queries
- `config_template.py` - Configuration template
- `requirements.txt` - Package dependencies
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide
- `CHANGELOG.md` - This file
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules

### Current State

✓ ArcGIS package installed and working
✓ All examples tested and functional
✓ Jupyter Lab running with working kernel
✓ PATH configured for command-line tools
✓ All documentation created
✓ Git repository initialized
✓ Ready to push to GitHub

### Package Versions (Final Working Configuration)

```
arcgis==2.3.1
jupyter-client==6.1.12
ipykernel==5.5.6
jupyter_server==1.24.0
jupyterlab==3.6.8
notebook==6.5.7
```

### Known Issues

- Warning: urllib3 OpenSSL compatibility (safe to ignore)
- Warning: dask dataframe (safe to ignore)
- Terminal feature disabled in Jupyter (requires jupyter_server 2.0+, not compatible with arcgis)
- Batch geocoding requires authentication (single geocoding works anonymously)

### Next Steps

- [ ] Create GitHub repository
- [ ] Push to GitHub
- [ ] Get ArcGIS Developer account (optional)
- [ ] Add credentials to config.py (optional)
- [ ] Start building custom applications!
